      content: "NVIDIA became the world's most valuable company, surpassing tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google for a while. ðŸš€ However, Microsoft reclaimed the crown on June 21, 2024, after NVIDIA's stocks declined by a steep 2%. ðŸ“‰ The company, co-founded by Jensen Huang, surpassed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company on June 20, 2024, with a market value of $3.335 trillion. However, it subsequently lost the position to long-time winner Microsoft. ðŸŒŸ This clearly demonstrates the volatility present in the market. ðŸ’± NVIDIA's success can be attributed to its focus on graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become essential for artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. As the demand for AI has skyrocketed, so too has NVIDIA's market cap.While Intel remains a significant player in the chip industry, it has struggled to keep pace with NVIDIA's advancements in AI technology.ðŸ“‰",

      content: "Why is GPT-4o free ? ðŸ¤”OpenAi, became one of the fastest growing companies in the realm of Ai and research ever since they released the mighty ChatGPT, with the world's biggest investors dying to be a part of the company, they have been charging the customers $20 a month ðŸ’µ to use their state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and its capabilities. Last month, OpenAi released GPT-4o, their best LLM till date. ðŸš€They utilized their launch event to highlight how fast, capable and better their model is than the rest in the market, but ever wondered WHY ARE THEY LETTING USERS AND DEVELOPERS USE THEIR BEST LLM FOR FREE ?? ðŸ¤”Well We got some answers:ðŸ”¹Lagging Behind: It's been an open truth that their most used GPT-3.5 model is now lagging behind, the performance has deteriorated, and the model has last been updated in late 2022's.ðŸ”¹Competition : With Meta's Llama 3, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3, OpenAi can see their competitors are getting ahead in the race, and they need a huge amount of public participation and investor involvement, to get their market share back.ðŸ”¹More Users = More Data : the larger amount of people use their new model, the larger the amount of data they can collect, and utilize to improve their newer as well as older models.ðŸ”¹The Store Creation: OpenAi knows that higher the amount of public popularity, higher number of developers will create products using their model, by allowing the users to use GPT-4o for free, it creates much more incentive for developers to create and use more GPTs.

      content: "GenAi and LLMs are the talk of the town ðŸš€, every company is rushing to get their latest and greatest LLM in the market, but wonder how India is performing in this High-Profile race? ðŸ¤”Here are some LLMs from India:ðŸ”¹KRUTRIM: The hottest topic these days, Krutrim is a Large Language Model developer by Krutrim Si Designs, an AI venture by OLA. The model will support 20+ languages, being trained on 2 trillion tokens and offering 7 and 13 billion parameter models.ðŸ”¹BharatGPT (CoRover.ai): CoRover.ai's BharatGPT has been generating a lot of buzz. It supports a whopping 120+ languages, including 14 officially recognized Indian languages, and claims a user base exceeding 1 billion. Their LLM is currently being used in India at IRCTC, LIC, IGL, Bhashini and many more renowned names.ðŸ”¹Project Indus (Tech Mahindra): Tech Mahindra's initiative to create an open-source LLM tailored for Indian scenarios. The model can supposedly work with most of the Indic languages with 37 dialects planned for the initial release. The model is currently undergoing beta testing within Tech Mahindra with 539 million parameters and is being trained on 10 billion tokens.ðŸ”¹IndicBERT (AI4Bharat): Another made-in-India LLM, built on the ALBERT architecture (a variant of the BERT architecture). The model currently supports 12 major Indian languages and is an open-source model available on GitHub and Hugging Face (AI4Bharat HuggingFace). The model has been trained on a total of 8.9 billion tokens (combining all supported languages).ðŸ”¹The Tata and Nvidia Alliance: Tata and Nvidia are joining forces to create a cutting-edge AI supercomputer powered by Nvidia's next-generation GH200 chip. This supercomputer will provide the immense processing power required to train and run large language models, which are computationally very demanding.ðŸ”¹The Reliance and Nvidia Partnership: Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, will leverage Nvidia's expertise to construct cutting-edge AI computing data centers across India. Reliance will be utilizing Nvidia's advanced technologies, including the powerful GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and the DGX Cloud, to address the processing needs of LLMs.What do you think of the progress India has made so far in the field of GenAi and LLMs?",
